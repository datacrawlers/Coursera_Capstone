    "Chicago is the third most-populous city in The United States and the most populous city in the State of Illinois. Having an estimated population of almost 3 million people, it is a central node of business, communication and transportation in the US.\n",

    "&emsp;2.\tMajor center for business in the Midwest<br>\n",
    "&emsp;3.\tEasy finding fundraising opportunities<br>\n",

    "With over 300.000 companies based in the city, in a 227 square miles area (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/chicagocityillinois\">see here the source</a>), it is real problem keeping the working environments clean. <br>\n",

    "&emsp;1.\tCan generate revenue quickly<br>\n",

    "&emsp;3.\tThe commercial cleaning is a very flexible industry, offering the access to a variety of businesses with a variety of needs<p>\n",

    "    \n",
    "The problem would be finding a suitable location for the startup, keeping in mind the following restrictions:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;1.\tMust be close to venues in most need of daily cleaning<br>\n",
    "&emsp;2.\tMust have a primary location, close to most popular venues in Chicago supposedly needing cleaning, where employees would be located and wait for requests, keep supplies and inventory<br>\n",
    "&emsp;3.\tCan have other secondary locations, if needed, for helping reducing transportation costs to/from cleaning locations<br>\n",
    "&emsp;4.\tThe startup will concentrate mostly on restaurant, bar and hotel businesses<br>\n",

    "One of the advantages of the solution is that, by choosing the top 15 areas by total number of venues – from bars, restaurants and hotels – a cleaning business can expect to generate quick revenues with low costs. <p>\n",
    "The cleaning industry is very diverse, but for the core services, depending also on clients’ needs, and choosing the right location of the point of work where to keep inventory and wait for service requests – it can be very rewarding and efficient for the business. <p>\n",
    "As presented above, area 60606 – is the best for opening a possible cleaning business; not only that it has the most venues, but it is also situated in the close location of the other postal codes; near main transportation nodes, it will have a competitive advantage versus the others. <p>\n",
    "On the other hand, the second choice for opening 60611 is closed to two areas with similar number of venues, up north Uptown 60640 (23 venues) and Lincoln Park 60614 (23 venues). This location is close to the Chicago Downtown area and it can easily represent a backup location, when needing additional workers or materials.<p>\n",
    "While trying to cluster the final information, we have noticed that only one cluster is generated with all information, which is usually unusual for the k-means clustering algorithm. In this case, we can assume that the doing additional investigation of the data would offer information on the optimal clusters, either by using the Elbow, Silhouette or the Gap Statistics method. <p>\n",
    "**Note:** Even though the Elbow Method identified below the optimal number of clusters to be 3, we can definitely say that the chosen dataset is homogeneous enough in order to result only one cluster, containing all areas.<p>\n",
    "On applying the homogeneity test chi-square, with a significance level of 0.05, we can confirm that all postal codes should be part of the same cluster 1. <p>"

    "We have presented in this report the identification of the best location to open a cleaning business in the Chicago area, by analyzing the Foursquare venue data and concluding our results based on top 15 areas by total number of venues (restaurants, bars, hotels).<p>\n",
    "I have built a model based on the provided venues information and mapped over the geospatial coordinates of the Chicago postal codes. The information was filtered by the total number of venues and presented in a bar chart and analyzed. <p>\n",
    "Two main locations were found as best candidates for opening a cleaning business in Chicago, based also on the fact that they are nearby most of the restaurants, hotels and bars from the area.<p>\n",
    "By doing a quick search on Google, we can find indeed many cleaning services business registered in the downtown area, where 60606 and 60611 are two of the most popular postal codes for existing companies in the domain.<p>\n",
    "As secondary sources of revenue for the business, laundry services can be provided in areas where hotels are in a high number, and deep clean services can be offered in areas where bars are located. <p>\n",
    "Future research can include additional services offered to other venue categories, based on costs and distance to potential clients.<p>"
