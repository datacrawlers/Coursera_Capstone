    "Chicago is the third most-populous city in The United States and the most populous city in the State of Illinois. Having an estimated population of almost 3 million people, it is a central node of business, communication and transportation in the US.\n",

    "According to <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/chicago-startup-city-talent-funding-inc-fast-growth-tour.html\">Inc.</a>, Chicago is one of the most hospitable cities for entrepreneurs and startup businesses, contrary to its harsh winters and high competitive environment.\n",

    "Among top reasons why one should open a business in this city are:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;1.\tDiverse and healthy business climate<br>\n",
    "&emsp;2.\tMajor center for business in the Midwest<br>\n",
    "&emsp;3.\tEasy finding fundraising opportunities<br>\n",

    "With over 300.000 companies based in the city, in a 227 square miles area (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/chicagocityillinois\">see here the source</a>), it is real problem keeping the working environments clean. <br>\n",

    "The problem would be finding a suitable location for the startup, keeping in mind the following restrictions:<br>\n",
    "&emsp;1.\tMust be close to venues in most need of daily cleaning<br>\n",
    "&emsp;2.\tMust have a primary location, close to most popular venues in Chicago supposedly needing cleaning, where employees would be located and wait for requests, keep supplies and inventory<br>\n",
